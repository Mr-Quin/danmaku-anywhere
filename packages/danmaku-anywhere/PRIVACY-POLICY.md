# Privacy Policy

## What we collect
We collect non-personally identifiable information to analyze and improve the extension. The data collection is handled differently for the extension's popup interface and the content script that runs on web pages.

### 1. General Extension Usage

This data is collected from your interactions with the extension's main user interface (the popup window).

- Interaction Data: We record anonymous events like clicks, scrolls, and interactions with UI elements (e.g., buttons, menus, sliders). This helps us understand which features are popular and how users navigate the extension.
- Content Data: We collect information about the structure of the extension's popup window to identify and fix UI/UX issues.

### 2. On-Page Usage (Content Script)

When the extension is active on a web page (e.g., when the + button is visible), a content script runs to provide its functionality. This script also collects anonymous telemetry.

- Page visit data: We collect URL of the page visited and the time spent on the page.
- Interaction Data: We record your interactions with the UI elements added by our extension on the page. We also collect general interaction data like clicks and scrolls on the page to understand how the extension's presence affect your experience.
- Anonymized Page Content Data: We record changes to the page's structure (the Document Object Model or DOM). In this process, all text, images, user-entered content, and other media on the page are redacted or replaced with placeholders.

## How we use your data

- To analyze feature usage and popularity
- To identify and resolve bugs and user experience issues

## Data Sharing and Third-Party Services

We do not sell, rent, or trade your data with any outside parties for marketing or other purposes.

To collect and analyze the anonymous usage data, we use Microsoft Clarity. This is a third-party analytics service that helps us understand user behavior through session recordings and heatmaps. All data sent to Clarity is subject to the redaction rules described above to protect your privacy.

## Opting Out

You can disable data collection by turning off the "Enable Analytics" option in the extension's settings. This will stop the collection of all anonymous usage data.
