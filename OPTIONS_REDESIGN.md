# Extension Options Page Redesign

## Overview
Redesigned the extension options page to eliminate nested options and provide a flat, more accessible user interface.

## Changes Made

### Before (Nested Structure)
The original options page had a navigation-based structure where users had to click through multiple levels:
- Main Options Page → Individual option categories → Specific settings
- Each category (Danmaku Source, Theme, Hotkeys, etc.) opened as separate pages
- Required back navigation to access different categories

### After (Flat Structure)
The new design presents all options on a single scrollable page with clear section dividers:

#### Sections Organized:
1. **General Settings** - Language selection
2. **Danmaku Sources** - Source toggles with expandable advanced settings
3. **Theme Settings** - Color mode selection (Light/Dark/System)
4. **Hotkey Settings** - All hotkey configurations
5. **Data Management** - Retention policy and data purging
6. **Advanced Settings** - Debug mode and simplified search
7. **Help & Support** - Documentation and support links

### Implementation Details

#### File Structure Changes:
- **Modified**: `Options.tsx` - Main options component redesigned for flat layout
- **Created**: Section components in `sections/` directory:
  - `DanmakuSourceSection.tsx` - Danmaku source management with accordions
  - `ThemeSection.tsx` - Theme selection
  - `HotkeySection.tsx` - Hotkey configuration
  - `RetentionPolicySection.tsx` - Data retention settings
  - `AdvancedSection.tsx` - Advanced options
- **Created**: Content components in `sections/components/`:
  - `BilibiliOptionsContent.tsx` - Bilibili-specific settings
  - `DanDanPlayOptionsContent.tsx` - DanDanPlay-specific settings

#### Router Changes:
- **Removed**: All nested routes under `/options`
- **Simplified**: Single route for options page
- **Cleaned up**: Unused imports from router configuration

#### User Experience Improvements:
1. **Single Page Access** - All options visible without navigation
2. **Clear Sections** - Visual dividers with section headings
3. **Expandable Details** - Advanced options in accordions for cleaner UI
4. **Better Scanning** - Users can quickly scan all available options
5. **Reduced Clicks** - No need to navigate back and forth between categories

### Technical Benefits:
- Reduced complexity in routing
- Better maintainability with modular section components
- Improved accessibility with flat navigation structure
- Faster user workflows

### Preserved Functionality:
- All existing options remain accessible
- Form validation and error handling maintained
- Real-time updates and persistence work as before
- Internationalization support preserved
