## Wait, what is danmaku?

Danmaku, also known as bullet comments or barrage comments, is a form of user-generated commentary that overlays a
video.

If you are familiar with vertical-scrolling chat rooms such as Twitch chat, danmaku is similar but with the comments
being displayed on the video itself.

## Usage

This extension has two operating modes:

- Manual Mode: Requires you to search for danmaku and manually mount them. Works on every website.
- Automatic Mode: Automatically searches for and mounts danmaku. Requires integration with each supported website.
  Currently only works on [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/).

### 1. Configure Where to Load Danmaku (Mount Config)

- In the extension's popup window, go to the "Config" tab.
- If your website is in the predefined list, enable it.
- If your website isn't listed:
  - Click "add" to create a new entry.
  - URL Patterns: Enter the website's match pattern (
    e.g., `https://your.website.com/*`).
    - [Learn more about match patterns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns)
    - For websites using `iframe` for its video player, the match pattern should be based on the `iframes`'s `src`
      attribute.
  - Video element: Enter the video
    player's [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) (often
    just `video`,
    unless the website has multiple video players).

### 2. Search for danmaku (Manual Mode or Ad-Hoc Use)

> [!NOTE]
> For most shows, searching in English will not work. Trying using the Japanese or Chinese title.

- In the extension's popup window, go to the "Search" tab.
- Enter the title and click on Search. (The Episode field should usually be left empty).
- In the results list, expand a result and click on each episode to download danmaku for that episode.

### 3. Mount danmaku (Manual Mode or Ad-Hoc Use)

> [!NOTE]
> You should be able to see the extension's floating button (a blue circle) on the page. If not, check if your mount
> config is correct before proceeding

- In the extension's popup window, go to the "Mount" tab.
- Select an episode in the dropdown selector, then click "Mount" to mount it over the video
- In manual mode, you'll need to repeat the steps above when the episode changes

### Automatic Mode

In automatic mode, the extension will parse the currently playing show and try to find matching danmaku. Automatic mode
can be turned off at anytime from the speed dial button.

Automatic mode requires manual integration with each website. Feel free to submit a feature request if you
want automatic mode for a specific website.

Below are the instruction for each integration.

#### Plex

In the Mount Config editor, select Plex from the integration dropdown.

- The extension uses the name and episode number of the currently playing media to match danmaku, so please make sure
  you library metadata is accurate.
- The extension cannot distinguish between videos and non-video contents (such as music), so please disable danmaku
  first before playing non-video content.

### Custom Danmaku

You can import custom danmaku by clicking on the "Import" button in the "Danmaku List" tab.

Custom danmaku adhere to the following format:

```typescript
interface CustomComment {
  mode?: 'ltr' | 'rtl' | 'top' | 'bottom' // default 'ltr'
  time: number // the time in seconds the comment should appear
  color: string // hex color code
  text: string // the comment text
}

interface CustomDanmaku {
  comments: CustomComment[] // at least one comment is required
  animeTitle: string
  // One of the following is required
  episodeTitle?: string
  episodeNumber?: number
}

type CustomDanmakuList = CustomDanmaku[]
```

Example

```json
[
  {
    "comments": [
      {
        "mode": "rtl",
        "time": 10,
        "color": "#FF5733",
        "text": "Hello World"
